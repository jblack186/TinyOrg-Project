# TinyOrganics Challenge


## Description
I The backend was built with Django and the frontend was built with React. I used SASS to style (i just like stickingn as close vanilla css when I can but on a larger project I would have just used a library to save time ). I did not implement Redux because it was a small project so a little prop drilling was no problem. 


## Getting Started

### Installing
Frontend -> cd into frontend directory Run npm install

Backend -> cd into to-project directory run pip install pipenv -> pipenv shell -> ip install -r requirements.txt -> pip freeze > requirement.txt


### Executing program
Backend -> cd into to-project directory and run python manage.py runserver to spin up dev server on port 8000

Frontend. cd into /frontend npm install then run npm start to start up dev server on port 3000
```
