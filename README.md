# TinyOrganics Challenge


## Description
I The backend was built with Django and the frontend was built with React. I used SASS to style (i just like stickingn as close vanilla css when I can but on a larger project I would have just used a library to save time ). I did not implement Redux because it was a small project so a little prop drilling was no problem. 


## Getting Started

### Installing
Frontend -> Run npm install to install all dependencies

Backend -> In root directory run pip install pipenv -> pipenv shell -> pipenv install django ->  pip install -r requirements.txt -> pip freeze > requirement.txt -> python manage.py migrate 


### Executing program
Frontend. cd into /frontend then run npm start to start up dev server on port 3000

Backend -> In root directory python manage.py runserver to spin up dev server on port 8000


```
